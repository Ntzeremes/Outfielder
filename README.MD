##Problem description
A ball is hit at a random horizontal and vertical angle and with a random speed.
An outfielder (glove) is spawned at a random spot on the field.
Using an algorithm the outfielder is approaching the ball so that the distance between them decreases.

##Program
This program displays the ball and outfielder moving at the field and the trajectory of the ball.
Additional information, such as the distance, vertical and horizontal angle between ball and outfielder
is shown on the screen.
